\maketitle
% we're not just translating proofs, but also the proof systems embedded in Eunoia.

\begin{abstract}
	\noindent
	Eunoia is a logical framework used formalizing the
	proof production facilities of SMT solvers.
	%
	We present an encoding of Eunoia signatures and theories
  into the \emph{$λΠ$-calculus modulo rewriting} as
  implemented by the $\lambdapi$ proof assistant.
	%
	Our encoding is demonstrated by the development
	of a tool \texttt{eo2lp}, which we used for
	(a) translating the portion of \texttt{cvc5}'s
	\textit{co-operating proof calculus} (CPC)
	corresponding to the QF-UF fragment of SMT-LIB; and
	%
	(b) translating proofs produced by running \texttt{cvc5}
	on a set of QF-UF problems from the SMT-LIB
	benchmark library.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclu}

We have presented a translation from Eunoia specifications and proofs
to the $\lambda\Pi$-calculus, as implemented in the $\lambdapi$ proof
assistant. Our tool \texttt{eo2lp} automates this translation and has
been demonstrated on a subset of the CPC signature and proofs from
QF-UF benchmarks.

It should be stressed that the presentation of Eunoia in this paper
only represents the core features, and there is more work to do in
order to (a) translate all of the CPC signature and therefore be able
to translate arbitrary \cvc{5} proofs, and (b) robustly cover the
entirety of Eunoia to be able to translate arbitrary Eunoia signatures
and proof scripts.

We should also aim to support larger proofs, as those from the rodin
benchmark have fewer than 70 proof steps. Some \cvc{5} proofs can be
massive, so computational and efficiency aspects of the translation
must be investigated.

For future work, we should also investigate using our translated
signatures and proof scripts in the realm of proof interoperability.
For example, to gain even more confidence in the results of \cvc{5},
one could attempt to prove the consistency of CPC, either within
$\lambdapi$ or by exporting to some other proof assistant like
Isabelle/HOL or Rocq.
